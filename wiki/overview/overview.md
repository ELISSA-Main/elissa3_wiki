# System Overview

The main part of the ELISSA system is the air bearing table. It provides a planar surface and air cushion for the freeflyer to move with reduced friction. The system is developed to recreate an on-orbit environment with low residual acceleration, low illumination and a motion capture system as a GPS equivalent. The system consists of four subsystems:

* Aeromechanical subsystem
* Motion tracking subsystem
* Freeflyer subsystem
* Mission control subsystem

These systems are essential for operations on the air bearing table. In addition to the laboratory the ELISSA framework provides a simulation environment. In this section, the following elements of the system are described:
