# Hamilcar Class Free-Flyers

> The Hamilcar class is the smaller and older FF class. It makes use of a primarily 3D-printed structure and affordable COTS electronics commonly found in the drone hobby sector.
> Two Hamilcar class FF are currently in operation, the class lead *Hamilcar* and *Red Five*.

# Payload Module
The payload module (PM) is constructed out of 20x20 Aluminum profiles, providing a versatile and modular structure for attaching payloads. Most commonly, this includes the *Gecko-Docking Mechanism* and the *Arduino KFL Science Payload* used for teaching. OptiTrack markers are also attached to the PM. Magnetic lids on the payload base provide access into the Service Module bay.
  
# Service Module
The Service Module (SM) houses the on-board computer (OBC), on-board power supply and provides additional space for housing electronics. The SM upper features the FF's name printed onto the left and right sides, allowing for easy identification. 
  
## OBC
A *Raspberry Pi 3 B* is utilized as the OBC.
